# Deepfake-Classifier
A deep learning classifier to determine if an image is **Real** or **Fake (Deepfake)**.

# 🎭 Deepfake Classifier

A project that applies **Deep Learning** to classify images as **Real or Fake**. Designed to help understand the real-world application of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** in media forensics and misinformation detection.

---

## 📌 Project Goal

Use a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to:
- Classify user-uploaded images as "Real" or "Fake"
- Demonstrate how deep learning can be applied to detect digital forgeries
- Provide an open-source tool for learning, research, or further development in media verification

---

## What this project does

This project is a **binary image classifier** for deepfake detection.
It demonstrates how a pre-trained deep learning model can analyze an image to find subtle artifacts and patterns indicative of AI-generation.

It is **not** a comprehensive forensic analysis suite or a video detector.
Instead, it focuses on a fundamental classification task:

> “Is this image real or was it generated by AI?”

---

## How it works

Given:
- **A pre-trained model** – e.g., EfficientNet, ResNet, or a custom CNN trained on a large dataset of real and fake images.
- **Input Image** – A user uploads an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG).

The classifier applies **inference** using the trained model to compute the **output probability**:
the updated probability that the image is 'Fake' vs. 'Real'.

---

## Why this matters

Deepfakes represent a significant challenge to digital trust. They can spread misinformation, commit fraud, and harass individuals.
This tool makes the detection process explicit and transparent.

It can be useful as:
- An **educational resource** for students and data scientists learning about CNNs and computer vision
- A **demo app** for understanding the capabilities and limitations of deepfake detection
- A **foundation** to expand toward more robust, multi-modal (video/audio) detection systems

## 💡 What is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?

A CNN is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. They use a series of 'filters' (convolutions) to automatically learn and detect hierarchical features in an image, from simple edges to complex patterns like eyes or artifacts.

> **Simplified Flow:**
Input Image -> [Convolution + Pooling Layers] -> [Flattening] -> [Fully Connected Layers] -> Output (Real / Fake)

Where:
- **Convolutional Layers:** Scan the image to find patterns and features.
- **Pooling Layers:** Reduce the image size while retaining the most important information.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Make the final classification decision based on the detected features.

## 🛠️ Features

- 🧠 Implements a deep learning model (e.g., EfficientNet, TensorFlow/Keras)
- 📤 Simple web interface to upload and classify images
- ⚙️ Simple, extensible Python script using Flask
- 👶 Beginner-friendly for open source contributors

---

## 🔍 Sample Use Case

> Given:
- A user uploads an image of a person's face.
- The model analyzes the image for inconsistencies in lighting, shadows, skin texture, or eye reflections.

### Output: 
Classification: FAKE Confidence: 98.78%

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Deepfake-Classifier.git](https://github.com/your-username/Deepfake-Classifier.git)
cd Deepfake-Classifier
```

(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.

On Windows (PowerShell):

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

On macOS / Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(Note: You may also need to download the pre-trained model file and place it in the /models directory if it's not included in the repo via Git LFS).

### 3. Run the App
```bash
python run.py
```
### 4. Open in Browser
```bash
[http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
```
